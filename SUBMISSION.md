Add CAPTION: SNPedia is a wiki-based bioinformatics website that serves as a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms.
AND TITLE: SNPedia

12. Add Exceptionals:

I web scraped the data from the website and built my own dataset.


This dataset is valuable beyond the scope of this project, as it can be useful for other projects as well.


I used MySQL data types not covered in class (ENUM, TEXT).


I have performed a query optimization by using the EXPLAIN command and adding indexes to the tables.
